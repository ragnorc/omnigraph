COMMANDS BY CAPABILITY:\n  \
any — run against a graph, served (--server / --profile) or embedded (--store / a \
URI): query, mutate, load, blob, branch, snapshot, export, commit, changes, schema show/apply.\n  \
served — require a server: graphs (registry scope).\n  \
direct — direct storage access; reject --server (init, upgrade, optimize, rebuild-full-text-indexes, \
repair, cleanup, schema plan, lint).\n  \
control — manage or inspect a cluster (cluster via --config; policy & queries via \
--cluster).\n  \
local — no explicit graph scope; local config & tooling: alias, embed, login, logout, profile, version.\n\
MANAGED FOLDERS: cluster commands use .omnigraph/context; data commands acquire identity credentials automatically.\n\
Implicit query, mutate, load and commit list/show use folder context and require --graph.\n\
Explicit target selectors retain ordinary addressing; competing ambient targets refuse.\n\
--direct selects ordinary addressing, including operator profiles and defaults.\n\
