//! The catalog of query compile diagnostic codes (RFC 0047). A code is
//! stable once published: its meaning is frozen, its message text may
//! improve. `Q…` codes are the parser's, `T…` codes the typechecker's, `P…`
//! codes the planner's; the
//! numbering has gaps where earlier stages were withdrawn, and a withdrawn
//! number is never reused.
