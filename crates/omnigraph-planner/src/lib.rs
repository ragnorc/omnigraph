//! Planner and optimizer for Omnigraph operations (RFC 0068).
//!
//! The crate owns four things: the logical plan an operation resolves to, the
//! physical plan the optimizer selects, the fixed pass sequence between them,
//! and the routing registry for change-feed and merge shapes. Read queries
//! always produce an engine plan; other operations retain their executor
//! until a plan route has integration and differential evidence. The planner
//! reads no environment and opens no data: every statistic a pass consults comes
//! through [`PlanSource`], which the engine implements over its pinned
//! snapshot, and every physical node is executed by an engine operator: the
//! [`Lower`] trait has one method per [`PhysicalNode`] variant,
//! [`PhysicalPlan::lower`] walks the plan itself, and the engine's report
//! names an operator of every node (`docs/dev/execution.md`, "V2 plan
//! lowering and operator ownership").
//!
//! [`plan_query`] builds executable read plans. [`route`] returns routing
//! decisions with explain diagnostics for an [`Operation`]. Traversals
//! resolve to topology-only `Expand` followed by a `Scan` restricted to input
//! identities. The scan owns the pinned destination read, storage predicate,
//! projection and, for a ranked binding, the [`RankedAccess`] the index
//! computes while scanning, preserving traversal multiplicity and order.
//! Query traversal schemas in this crate remain conservative input schemas;
//! the engine derives their complete runtime output schemas from the catalog.
