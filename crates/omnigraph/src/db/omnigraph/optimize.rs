//! Lance compaction + version cleanup exposed at the graph level.
//!
//! Lance accumulates many small `.lance` fragment files per backing dataset over the
//! life of a graph: each `write`, `load`, and `change` op appends one or more
//! fragments and a new manifest. Over long timescales this hurts open times
//! and S3 object counts without improving anything.
//!
//! Two dials:
//!
//! * `optimize_all_datasets` — stages Lance compaction on every dataset as
//!   detached commits and **publishes them together in one `__manifest`
//!   batch**, so each registration's pin names the compacted version (reads
//!   pin the published dataset version, so without the publish compaction
//!   would be invisible to readers). Compaction is content-preserving (Lance
//!   `Operation::Rewrite` "reorganizes data without semantic modification"),
//!   so old fragments remain reachable through older `__manifest` versions
//!   until `cleanup` stops retaining them.
//! * `cleanup_all_datasets` — the engine's tracing collector
//!   (`collector.rs`); stock `cleanup_old_versions` is never called on a
//!   graph table. `--keep` / `--older-than` choose the retained `__manifest`
//!   versions per live branch; the collector keeps every file those
//!   versions, tags and merge bases reach and deletes the rest. Destructive
//!   to unreferenced version history — callers should gate this behind an
//!   explicit confirm flag at the CLI layer.
