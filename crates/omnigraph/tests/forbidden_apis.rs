//! Forbidden-API and graph-write protocol guard tests.
//!
//! Engine code (`exec/`, `db/omnigraph/`, `loader/`, `changes/`) MUST NOT
//! call Lance's inline-commit data-write APIs directly. The
//! `Storage` trait (`crate::storage_layer::TableStorage`) is the canonical
//! surface; graph rows route through the exact-id `stage_keyed_write` adapter,
//! while the remaining staged primitives plus `commit_staged` are the only way
//! to advance Lance HEAD. Bare `stage_append` is compiled only for private
//! primitive tests, never as a graph-visible keyed route.
//!
//! The raw storage modules are crate-private and the trait is sealed (only
//! `TableStore` implements it), so Rust visibility is the primary boundary.
//! This test is **defense in depth**: it catches known cases where engine code
//! reaches around that boundary by importing `lance::dataset::*` types directly.
//!
//! ## How it works
//!
//! The walks cover `crates/omnigraph/src/**/*.rs` plus the `GUARDED_CRATES`
//! sources (`crates/omnigraph-core/src`, `crates/omnigraph-catalog/src`), labeled
//! by crate (`omnigraph-core/<relative>`, `omnigraph-catalog/<relative>`); the
//! durable-call inventory and the callable-gateway registry also walk
//! `crates/omnigraph-storage/src` (`omnigraph-storage/<relative>`), and the
//! public re-export walk reads the engine alone. No walk reads a `tests/`
//! directory. The
//! legacy forbidden-Lance check keeps a lexical deny-list for type and builder
//! construction, while the graph-write guard parses Rust with `syn` so split
//! calls, method syntax, and UFCS are counted structurally. Lines whose
//! preceding line contains the sentinel comment
//! `// forbidden-api-allow: <reason>` are exempt from the lexical deny-list —
//! reviewers see the sentinel in diff and can ask whether the exemption is
//! justified.
//!
//! The graph-write protocol guard is structural rather than grep-based. It
//! parses Rust with `syn`, classifies all public async inherent `Omnigraph`
//! methods plus loader conveniences, and counts registered durable-call shapes
//! by file. The pinned method and UFCS forms, and production items after a test
//! module, therefore cannot evade it. Self-tests also pin the selected
//! rename/macro-token shapes that are rejected. This source scanner is not a
//! Rust macro expander or general function-pointer alias analysis; visibility
//! remains the structural closure.
//!
//! ## What's deliberately outside the lexical deny-list
//!
//! - `crates/omnigraph/src/table_store.rs` — the crate-private storage layer.
//!   The forbidden Lance APIs live here legitimately.
//! - The exact manifest gateway implementations listed below — bootstrap,
//!   namespace plumbing, row-level publishing, and recovery — plus their
//!   out-of-line test module.
//! - `crates/omnigraph/src/storage_layer.rs` — IS the trait module.
//!
//! Every production file in that lexical allow-list is still parsed by the
//! structural registry. Only standalone files compiled exclusively through a
//! parent `#[cfg(test)]` module are omitted from that pass. The callable
//! surfaces of the storage and manifest gateways are also pinned exactly, so a
//! new wrapper cannot hide behind a new primitive name.
//!
//! ## Allow-list shape
//!
//! After the exact EnsureIndices adapter, `db.storage()` (`&dyn TableStorage`)
//! exposes only staged primitives + reads and there is no separate inline
//! residual surface. Vector index creation uses pinned Lance's full-table
//! `execute_uncommitted` path inside `stage_create_indices`; `delete` likewise
//! migrated to `stage_delete` in MR-A (Lance 7.0 #6658).
//! The dead legacy methods
//! (trait `append_batch` / `merge_insert_batches`, inherent
//! `merge_insert_batch{,es}`, `create_{btree,inverted}_index`) were
//! removed entirely. The lexical pass catches direct `lance::*` misuse outside
//! the implementation boundary; the structural pass exact-counts the raw
//! builder/commit shapes inside that boundary as well.
