# Diagnostics

Every refusal of a query carries four things: a stable code, where the failure
is, what was expected or violated, and one concrete fix. The reader is often
an agent that treats an error as the documentation it acts on, so the fix
names the construct to use, not the rule that was broken. A refusal with no
fix names the decision instead.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `code` | Stable identifier: `Q…` from the parser, `T…` from the type checker, `P…` from the planner. A code's meaning is frozen; its message text may improve. |
| `position` | For a parse refusal: `line` and `column` (1-based, in characters) and the `byte` offset. |
| `stage` and `expression` | For a refusal after parsing: the stage (`typecheck` or `plan`) and, when the site can render it, the expression it refused. |
| `expected` | What was expected or violated, one line, without a position. |
| `fix` | One concrete fix, absent when `expected` names the decision. |
| `suggestion` | Optional source edits with `applicability`, plus `start`, `end` and `replacement` for each edit. |

The one-line `error` text is the code and the expectation in the legacy form
(`parse error: …`, `type error: T33: …`, `plan error: P001: …`); the other
fields travel beside it.

## The measured case

A declaration without its parameter list:

```text
query name {
```

```text
error[Q002]: parse error: expected `(`: a query declares its parameters even when it has none
  --> line 1, column 11
  fix: query name()
```

Earlier releases reported this at the file's first position as `expected
query_file`.

## Typed suggestions

The `fix` remains human-readable guidance. When the compiler can propose a
specific edit, `suggestion` carries it as data. For example, this source:

```text
query name { match { $p: Person } return { $p.name } }
```

receives this suggestion alongside Q002:

```json
{
  "applicability": "machine_applicable",
  "edits": [{ "start": 10, "end": 10, "replacement": "()" }]
}
```

Ranges use zero-based UTF-8 byte offsets in the exact original request source,
with an exclusive `end`. Equal offsets insert text. Ranges do not overlap;
apply multiple edits from the highest offset to the lowest. Do not apply an
edit to a source that has changed since the request.

`machine_applicable` means the compiler has enough evidence for this local
correction. `needs_review` means the caller must review the proposed change.
Neither value guarantees that the corrected query will pass every check;
validate it again. The compiler does not apply suggestions automatically.

Q002 offers the `()` insertion only when the edited file matches the grammar
without another missing-parameter recovery. Incomplete or ambiguous input can
still receive textual guidance while omitting `suggestion`. Missing suggestions
do not mean there is no possible fix.

## Where the fields appear

- **CLI, human formats** (`table`, `kv`, `csv`): the form above on stderr,
  exit status 1, with no colour codes and no backtrace footer.
- **CLI, machine formats**: `--json` and `--format json` print the API's error
  body pretty, `--format jsonl` prints it as one line, both on stdout with
  exit status 1. A served refusal keeps the server's `code` field
  (`bad_request`); an embedded one has none.
- **HTTP**: a `400` that refuses a query carries the additive `diagnostic`
  object in its error body. See
  [HTTP errors](../operations/troubleshooting.md#http-errors).
- **`omnigraph lint`**: a `Q000` finding whose message is the expectation at
  `line <n>, column <c>`; type errors report their `T…` code. See
  [Linting](index.md#linting).
- **`queries validate --json` and `cluster plan --json`**: each breakage or
  query parse/typecheck failure carries the same diagnostic information as
  `diagnostic` or `detail`, so a stored query the next release would refuse
  is a pre-upgrade finding. Cluster `detail` uses the compiler shape: `message`
  and a nested `stage` object. API and validation output use `expected` and
  separate `stage`/`expression` fields.

```json
{
  "error": "parse error: expected `(`: a query declares its parameters even when it has none",
  "code": "bad_request",
  "diagnostic": {
    "code": "Q002",
    "position": { "line": 1, "column": 11, "byte": 10 },
    "expected": "expected `(`: a query declares its parameters even when it has none",
    "fix": "query name()"
  }
}
```

## Parse codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Q001` | The source does not match the grammar at the reported position; `expected` names the grammar rules the parser could accept there. |
| `Q002` | A query declaration is missing its parameter list. |
| `Q003` | A settings statement is refused: unknown setting, value outside its row, or a process setting in a request. |
| `Q004` | A branch, show or explain statement is misplaced or malformed. |
| `Q005` | A declaration body is refused; `expected` names the construct. |

Type codes are listed where the construct they guard is described, in
[Query language](index.md).

## Planner codes

A planner code refuses a well-formed, type-checked query shape by design. It
is the caller's error, answered as a bad request with the diagnostic, never as
an internal error.

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `P001` | A ranking (`nearest`, `bm25`) orders a binding that a traversal reaches from another binding. The fix declares that binding first in `match`, so the ranking starts the traversal. |
| `P002` | An edge alternation or wildcard traversal has no finite traversal work limit. The fix sets `traversal_work_limit` before the query. |
| `P003` | The traversal work limit is outside `1..=9223372036854775807`, or a plan records it twice. |
| `P004` | An edge alternation or wildcard traversal was asked to run in CSR traversal mode; it runs in `auto` or `indexed` mode. |

A refusal caused by the graph's state rather than the query's shape carries no
planner code. A full-text call on a declared index that no build has reached is
a `409` conflict carrying `full_text_index_required`; it persists until the
index is built (see [Full-text search](../search/index.md#full-text-search)).
