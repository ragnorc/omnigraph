# Search

OmniGraph combines vector, full-text, and graph patterns in one `.gq` query.
Search expressions can filter or order a matched node set; a `limit` is required
for nearest-neighbor ordering.

## Functions

| Function | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `nearest($d.embedding, $q)` | Rank vectors by L2 distance. `$q` may be a vector or text that the configured embedding provider converts to a vector. |
| `search($d.body, $q)` | Full-text token search. |
| `fuzzy($d.body, $q [, max_edits])` | Full-text search with edit-distance tolerance. |
| `match_text($d.body, $q)` | Match a full-text query in a `match` block. |
| `bm25($d.body, $q)` | BM25 relevance score. |
| `rrf(rank_a, rank_b [, k])` | Fuse two rankings with Reciprocal Rank Fusion. The default `k` is 60. |

Filters in the `match` block are applied before ranking, so `limit 10` means the
top ten matches that satisfy the graph and property filters.

A `bm25()` ordering reads every matching entity before applying the final
limit. Equal scores are then ordered by entity identity, including when the
smallest identity lies beyond the first search candidates.

Full-text rankings inside `rrf()` are
never bounded this way: each full-text arm scans every matching entity, and
fusion ranks the entities that satisfy the graph and property filters, so
bounding an arm could silently drop an entity's contribution and shift fused
results. When a traversal constrains the ranked variable and the graph shows
few entities could satisfy it, the full-text arms instead rank only those
entities (an unbounded, index-served prefilter — results are identical, the
scan is just smaller); broad traversals keep the full scan. A `nearest()`
ranking inside `rrf()` is inherently top-k, as vector
search always is: an entity outside its window adds no vector contribution
to its fused score, so a traversal that drops the window's top matches can
shift fused ranks.

## Vector search

```gq
query similar($q: Vector(4)) {
  match { $d: Document }
  return { $d.slug, $d.title }
  order { nearest($d.embedding, $q) }
  limit 10
}
```

Raw vectors are ranked with L2 distance. Vectors produced by OmniGraph's
embedding client are normalized, so L2 and cosine similarity produce the same
ordering for those generated vectors. See [Embeddings](embeddings.md) for text
queries and provider configuration.

IVF vector searches keep Lance's adaptive one-partition minimum and cap the
partitions a `nearest` scan reads at 20 per index delta by default. The cap
prevents Lance's centroid-distance heuristic from expanding a small search
across the entire index; larger values can improve recall at the cost of
latency and object-store I/O.

A capped scan that returns fewer candidates than requested with partitions
left unread is rerun with the cap raised four-fold, then without a cap, until
the candidates are found or the index is exhausted. A scan that ended short
for any other reason (every matching row found, the whole type read) is not
rerun. When a traversal or a filter above the scan drops candidates and
leaves `limit` unfilled, the query asks the scan for four times, then
sixteen times, the requested candidates; a query whose survivors are rarer
than one in sixteen of the nearest candidates then runs one exact pass over
the whole type (every row with an embedding ranked, no cap), taken sooner
once a rung would cover the whole type anyway, so `limit` is
filled whenever that many survivors exist; a query whose survivors are permanently fewer than
`limit` pays that whole-type pass on every execution. A `nearest` ordering constrained by a traversal is first restricted
to the entities that can satisfy the traversal's first hop when few entities
can (the same gate `rrf()` uses), and ranks only those. A `nearest()` arm
inside `rrf()` is a top-k window: the arm's scan widens its own cap, but a
traversal that drops the arm's rows shortens the fused answer. As with every
IVF search, a full candidate count does not make the ANN ranking exact; the
cap remains a recall/latency tradeoff.

| Setting or variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ann_nprobes` ([session setting](../queries/index.md#session-settings), `request` scope; process default `OMNIGRAPH_ANN_NPROBES`) | Partition cap per index delta of a `nearest` scan; default 20, `0` removes the cap, an invalid value refuses startup |
| `OMNIGRAPH_RRF_GATE_RATIO` | Fraction of the ranked type below which a traversal-constrained `nearest` or `rrf()` prefilters its scan; default 0.10, `0` turns the gate off, an invalid value is the default |
| `OMNIGRAPH_RRF_GATE_MAX_IDS` | Largest eligible set the gate pushes into the scan; default 100000, `0` turns the gate off, an invalid value is the default |
| `rrf_plan` ([session setting](../queries/index.md#session-settings), `process` scope; process default `OMNIGRAPH_RRF_PLAN`) | `auto` (default), `force_prefilter`, or `force_postfilter`, for diagnosis. On a traversal-constrained `nearest`, `force_postfilter` can leave `limit` unfilled and `force_prefilter` ranks the eligible entities regardless of the size threshold |

## Full-text search

Use full-text functions for token search, fuzzy terms, and relevance. Use the
query language's exact `contains` and `starts_with` predicates for literal,
case-sensitive substring and prefix matching.

`search`, `match_text`, and `fuzzy` are positive predicates in `match`: use
a standalone call or compare the call to literal `true` with `=`. Other
comparisons, including `= false`, `!= true`, a Boolean parameter, and a
call on the right side, are refused at type checking (`T38`).

Every full-text call (`search`, `match_text`, `fuzzy` and `bm25`) reads its
property's full-text index, whose analyzer decides how the text and the query
are split and normalized, case included. The property must declare one, a
free-text String with `@index` ([Indexes](#indexes)); a call on any other
property is refused at type checking (`T27`). The index must also have a built
segment at the snapshot the query reads. Until a build reaches a declared
index, a call on it is refused at planning with `full_text_index_required`
(HTTP 409); `omnigraph build-indexes --branch <branch>` builds a branch's
missing indexes, and `omnigraph optimize` builds them on `main` as part of its
maintenance. A type with no rows needs no build. Rows written after the last build are matched
with the built index's analyzer by a scan, so they are found before the next
build.

```gq
query relevant($q: String) {
  match { $d: Document }
  return { $d.slug, bm25($d.body, $q) as score }
  order { bm25($d.body, $q) desc }
  limit 10
}
```

`score` is the relevance the ordering used, one computation observed twice:
the projected `bm25(...)` must repeat the leading `order` key (`T33`), and
`nearest(...)` projects its distance the same way; that distance is the
squared L2 distance Lance ranks by. Without an alias the column is
`d._score` or `d._distance`. `rrf(...)` in `return` is refused until the
fused score becomes a column (`T37`), and so is a `nearest(...)` or
`bm25(...)` that appears only as an `rrf` arm, and so are the predicates
`search(...)`, `fuzzy(...)` and `match_text(...)` (`T35`).

Exact String predicates remain correct without an index. A free-text index does
not accelerate equality, `starts_with`, or literal substring `contains`.

## Hybrid ranking

Reciprocal Rank Fusion combines rankings without assuming their raw scores use
the same scale:

```gq
query hybrid($vector: Vector(4), $text: String) {
  match { $d: Document }
  return { $d.slug, $d.title }
  order { rrf(nearest($d.embedding, $vector), bm25($d.body, $text)) }
  limit 10
}
```

Ranking order is a contract, not a side effect: search-ordered results are
sorted on the search score itself, including through multi-hop traversals, with
secondary keys and the entity-id tie-break applied after the score. The full
ordering contract lives on the [queries page](../queries/index.md).

## Indexes

`@index` and `@key` declare index intent. For a single-property node declaration,
OmniGraph currently creates:

| Property | Index use |
|---|---|
| Enum, number, Boolean, Date, or DateTime | Equality, range, membership, and null filters |
| Free-text String | Full-text functions |
| Vector | `nearest` |

Node ids and edge ids/endpoints are indexed automatically. Lists and Blobs do
not receive property indexes. Composite declarations and edge-property
declarations do not currently create property indexes.

Indexes are derived performance data. A new declaration may still be pending,
and newly written entities may fall outside existing coverage. Queries remain
correct by scanning uncovered data; vector search falls back to an exact scan
when needed. A full-text call is the exception for a declared index that has
never been built: without a built segment there is no analyzer to match with,
so the call is refused rather than answered by a different one (see
[Full-text search](#full-text-search)). Run:

```bash
omnigraph optimize graph.omni
```

after a large load or merge, and on a regular maintenance cadence, to refresh
coverage and compact data. An empty vector property remains pending until it has a
non-null vector to index.
